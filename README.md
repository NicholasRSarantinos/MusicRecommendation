# Music Recommendation

The end goal is to create a music player able to determine which songs to play by utilizing the data stream from Emotiv Insight BCI, as well as other user related information. To date music similarity has been implemented.

Information about the project are available [here](http://www.sarantinos.me/#musiceeg)

The application relies on [MTG/Essentia](http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/) and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) and can be compiled under a Linux environment.

Music files by default have to be added on /home/music_to_index directory.
